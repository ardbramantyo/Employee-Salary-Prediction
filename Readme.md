## Emoloyee Salary Prediction using Polynomial Linear Regression
### Overview Scenario
I work as a consultant to a start-up company that has just started to hire employees. The HR director reached out to me and asked to predict the salary of employees based on the number of years of experience. I suggested to use a polynomial regression as a proposed model based on the provided dataset.

There are Three Scenario developed to find the best model"
1. Linear
2. Polynomial (Order: 2)
3. Polynomial (Order: 3)
